              <h1>Chapter 1: Assignments</h1>
              <p>A computer has a memory like we humans do have and it is super
              important. Without a memory, a comuter is useless. It can't do
              anything useful without it. The same goes for our brains if you
              think about it. And I mean in particular our short term memory.
              Think about it, if you cook same pasta, and you don't know anymore
              if you had salted the boiling water or not. It happens sometimes I know.
              Or if you have to add two bigger numbers, during the calculation
              you will have to remember to carry a digit, most of us are only
              comfortable to do the math with pen and paper, because it is so
              super important not to forget the in between results.</p>
              <p>So how does a computer remember stuff? This is actually very
              easy. By telling the computer to do so. You, the programmer,
              command the computer be saying: "Store this in your memory, put
              this into a box and stick this label onto the box." So to say, the
              computer's memory is a storage with many unlabeled boxes. You the
              programmer can write something on a label, for example
              <code>number of party guests</code>, than you write the number
              onto a piece of paper and say to the computer: "Here put this
              paper into a box and stick this label to it!" Now you can come
              back anytime and ask to computer to look what's inside the box
              with the label <code>number of party guests</code> and the
              computer will happily tell you.</p>

              <p>Now many of you think, well I did know this before. I can open
              a text document and write a number, and name the document "number
              of party guests" and save it. That is correct in a sense, but
              difference is, in this case you are not the programmer, you are
              the user of a programm, that was programmed by someone else, a
              programmer. You what you are doing is, you say to the application,
              remember this, and the application than, will tell the computer to
              remember. However, as a programmer, you talk directly to the
              computer.</p>

              <p>But how? Do you have to speak loudly into the microphone: "Hey
              computer, put this in a box and stick this label onto it!" You can
              try, but it will not work. What we as programmers have to do, is
              to write a programm, which then the computer will read and
              execute. So ware telling the computer what to do, by writing it
              down. And we have to write it down in a way so that the computer
              understands everything. And the computer does not speak English,
              the computer only speads programming languages, like SimpleScript.
              So we as programmers have to learn a programming language before
              we can give commands to the computer. But don't worry, it is far
              more easy than to learn aonther human spoken language. When you
              speak around 30-40 words of this new language, and learn a few
              simple grammer rules, you can tell the computer anything you can
              imangine, and the computer will execute all your commands.</p>

              <p>Okay, let's start: How do we say to a computer: "Store this in
              a box and label it with this!" This is super simple. In the
              language SimpleScript you say with this single sign
              <code>=</code>. So to come back to our example, let's tell the
              computer to remember how many friends assured to come to our party so
              far. Therfore
              we need an editor to write it down. Just here below is an open
              editor we can use. And I already wrote down the command.
              </p>
              <div id="editor" style="height: 50px;">
              </div>
              <div id="mapping">

              </div>
              <div><p>Here below is the computer's storage, or memory. It's
                empty in the beginning. You can see that each little box has a
                number. That's only interesting for the computer, so that it
                knows which box is where.</p></div>
              <div id="memory">

              </div>
              <div class="btn-group">
                <button id="step-btn" type="button" class="btn
                  btn-default">Execute</button>
              </div>
              <p>So let's examine this command in detail:
              <code>number_of_guests</code> is our label. We can choose here
              whatever we want, but we have to follow some rules, which we will
              see later.<code>=</code> is the verb in this command. It can be
              translated with <b>remember</b> or <b>put into
                box</b>.<code>20</code> is actually what the computer should
              remember, this what the computer should put into the box.</p>
              <p> And
              last, but not least, and actually super important we have to end
              our command properly with the <code>;</code> sign. It is similar
              important as putting a <b>.</b> to the end of every sentence when
              you write something in English. Without it, it's a mistake.
              </p>

              <p>Okay, let's try it out! Click on the button that
              says <b>execute</b> and look how our number is stored into the
              first box in the computer's memory.</p>
            </div>
